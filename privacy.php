      The Information We Collect

      (a) to allow us to know when users return to our website and which pages or services you access while there; and
      
      (b) to gather information on an aggregate basis in order to identify the most popular areas of our Website and make it easier for users to access them.
      
      4. You are encouraged to visit our Website and make enquiries in relation to our products and services.
